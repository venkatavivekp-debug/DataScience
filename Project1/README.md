# Data Science Coursework Projects

**Author:** Venkata Vivek Panguluri  
**University:** University of Georgia  

This repository contains two Data Science projects demonstrating regression, model evaluation, and neural-network methods.

## 📘 Project 1 — Regression Models
Folder: `Project1/`  
Implements simple, multiple, and regularized regression (Ridge & Lasso) with evaluation metrics RMSE and R².

## 🤖 Project 2 — Neural Networks and Gradient Descent
Folder: `Project2/`  
Implements perceptron and multilayer neural networks using gradient-descent optimization (GD vs IGD) and compares them to classical regression models.
