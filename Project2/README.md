# Data Science — Project 2: Neural & Regression Models

**Author:** Venkata Vivek Panguluri

## Overview
Comparison of classical regression (Project 1 baseline) vs. neural models (perceptron / 3-layer) trained with GD and IGD. Implemented with Scala/Scalation; results include R², SSE and convergence behavior.

## Structure
- `src/` — code (e.g., SimpleNN.scala)
- `results/` — HTML outputs & plots
- `docs/` — report PDF

## Reproduce
Open code/notebooks, place data locally if needed, and save plots to `results/`.
