# Data Science — Project 2: Neural & Regression Models

**Author:** Venkata Vivek Panguluri

## Overview
Comparison of classical regression vs. neural models (perceptron / 3-layer) trained with gradient descent (GD) and incremental GD (IGD). Implemented in Scala/Scalation; results include R², SSE and qualitative convergence comparisons.

## Structure
- `src/` — code (e.g., SimpleNN.scala)
- `results/` — run outputs & plots (HTML)
- `docs/` — report (PDF)

## Reproduce
1) Open notebooks/code as needed (Scala or Python).
2) Place any large data under `data/` (ignored).
3) Save plots to `results/`.
